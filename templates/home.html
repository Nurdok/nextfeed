     	It's built in a way that
     	lets you read your favorite subscriptions without the overhead that
     	most readers present.<br/>
     	With <em>nextfeed</em>, you define a list of feeds you want to follow,
     	and get a personalized URL. Every time you hit that URL, you'll get the
     	next unread entry in your feeds.<br/>
     	That's it.
